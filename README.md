I wanted to practice the flex features and be able to set up a layout primarily. I was unable to change the font quote font to lighter or a 300 font-weight which was a bit annoying. Searching around online it wasn't particularly clear which font-familys support lighter weight fonts and I eventually just chose to finish the assignment rather than get stuck looking around for that. 

I'm unsure if the flex properties that were used were used appropriatly or if there were areas I could have incorporated them that I did not. I'm not fully confident on growing/shrinking functionality here. I didn't use flex: "xyz" once but I don't think it was needed?
